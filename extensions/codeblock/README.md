codeblock.js
============

A jQuery plugin to create editable, runnable blocks of javascript code. Great for demos and api documentation. It's what we use on the [Ink Filepicker Javascript Docs](https://developers.inkfilepicker.com/docs/web/)

The full API documentation and demos are available at http://ink.github.io/codeblock.js/
